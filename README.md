This project provides the resources required to make a automated pipetting machine
used in biology labs.

The project describes the hardware  and assembly requirements  
along with the electronic and code components to build a gantry robot on which a 
standard pipeteman can be mounted.

However, at this stage only the controller code is publicably available on this repository.
The code is part of an opensource project I wish to make on an affordable lab pipetting robot that can mount a standard lab pipette. 

A video of the prototype can be found here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlGT0nzT_E8

The provided version of the code operates the prototype  and can provide the basis for future development. However, I have yet to provide sufficient documantation for thise project , and thus thus this holds back release to the public domain as a complete open project which I can share.
